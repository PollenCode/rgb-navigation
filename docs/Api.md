# REST API

If you've got an api key, you can use the following api to upload effects, update effects and set routes programmatically.
(api keys can only be generated by rgb.ikdoeict.be administrators)

You can use the [npm package](http://npmjs.com/package/rgb-navigation-api) if possible, otherwise, use the instructions below on how to request these things from the server manually.

## Important!

1. All of the following urls should start with `https://rgb.ikdoeict.be`.
2. All of the following routes must be authenticated by setting the `Authorization` header to `Bearer <yourtokenhere>`

## Routes

**Only the routes that can be used with an api key are displayed, the other routes require a user**

### `POST /api/effectVar/:varName/:value`

Sets a variable on the led controller

-   Replace `:varName` with the variable name in the currently uploaded program you wish to set.
-   Replace `:value` with a numerical value to set in the variable.

### `POST /api/effect/:id/build?upload=true`

Uploads effect with id to the led controller.

-   Replace `:id` with the effect id you wish to upload.

### `GET /api/effect`

Returns all effects in JSON format.

### `POST /api/route`

Creates a route from a to b with color and duration.

Make sure to add the `Content-Type: application/json` header and include the following body:

```json
{
    "startLed": 0,
    "endLed": 100,
    "duration": 1,
    "r": 255,
    "g": 255,
    "b": 0
}
```

-   `startLed`: the starting led to begin drawing the route line
-   `endLed`: the ending led to stop drawing at (can be lower than startLed to create a route in the opposite direction)
-   `duration`: the amount of seconds to show the route
-   `r`: red value (0 -> 255)
-   `g`: green value (0 -> 255)
-   `b`: blue value (0 -> 255)

### `POST /api/roomRoute/:roomNumber`

Creates a route to a fixed room.

-   Replace `:roomNumber` with the room number (0 -> 6).

### `POST /api/effect/carrousel/:seconds`

Enables or disables the effect carrousel.

-   Replace `:seconds` with the interval to switch between favorite effects or use 0 to disable the carrousel.

## Examples

### Setting a single or multiple leds

It is not directly possible to set a led directly via an api route. To achieve this you must first create a new effect and create some unset variables:

```c
// (new effect created at https://rgb.ikdoeict.be/effects/mine)

byte red;
byte green;
byte blue;

r = red
g = green;
b = blue;
```

Then, upload this effect program to the led controller (either via the webapp or via the api route above).

When uploaded, the led strip should turn completely black, this is because the `red`, `green` and `blue` variables are initialized to zero on upload.

Now that the effect is active, you can set the `red`, `green` and `blue` variables using the `/api/effectVar/:varName/:value` route in the following ways. This change will be sent to the led controller and the ledstrip will change color.

- Set the `red` variable to `255`: `POST /api/effectVar/red/255`
- Set the `green` variable to `150`:`POST /api/effectVar/green/150`
- Set the `blue` variable to `0`: `POST /api/effectVar/blue/0`
