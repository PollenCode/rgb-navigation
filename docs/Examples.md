# Examples

This chapter contains example programs for the ledstrip written in [RGBLang](). You can also use it is a tutorial because the programs get more complicated each time.

### Solid color

The following program sets every led on the ledstrip to a bright red.

```c
// This will be executed for each led
r = 255
g = 0
b = 0
```

The `r`, `g` and `b` variables contain the red green and blue values for the current led on the led strip. You can read and write these.
These variables are bytes, this means they have a minumim value of 0 and a maximum value of 255. **Do not assign negative values to these! This will cause an integer overflow (-1 will be 255, -2 will be 254 ...), this is probably not what you want.**

### Gradient

To create more complex effects, you can use the `index` variable, which contains the index of the led on the ledstrip for which the program is currently executing.

```c
// index can be 0 - 784 if your ledstrip contains 784 leds
r = 0
g = index / 3 // Divide by 3 to match 255 as max green value
b = 0
```

This code shows a gradient from black to green.

### Moving animation

To create moving animations, you should use the builtin `timer` variable. This variable contains the amount of milliseconds since the program has started running.

```c
r = 0
g = 0
// Limit timer to 0 - 255 using modulus
b = timer % 255
```

This will show a flashing blue color. This is a rather sudden transition, it is better to use the builtin `sin()` function to create a smooth transition from blue to black:

```
r = 0
g = 0
b = sin(timer)
```

You can also use the `cos()` function, look [here]() for a list of builtin utility functions.

### Combine timer and index

You can combine the `index` and `timer` variables to create epic ðŸ˜Ž animations.

This animation shows a moving red wave:

```c
// index contains n-th led, timer increases each frame
r = sin(index * 10 + timer / 10)
g = 0
b = 0
```

This animation moves a single red dot from the start of the ledstrip to the end:

```c
b = 0
g = 0
if (index == (timer / 50) % 30) {
    // Create dot
    r = 255
}
else  {
    // Trail effect
    // r - 10 can be negative, which will cause problems
    // use the max function to ensure it is at least 0
    r = max(r - 10, 0)
}
```
